## Requirements

- Zig 0.15
- River Wayland compositor 0.4.x (with river-window-management-v1 protocol)

## Features

**Multiple layout:** tile, grid, monocle, scroller, floating

**Tag:** base tags not workspaces (supports separate window layouts for each tag)

**Rule support:** regex rule match

**Bindings:** bindings in different mode such as default, passthrough orelse your custom mode

**Rich window state:** swallow, maximize, fullscreen, fakefullscreen

**With simple status bar:** dwm like bar

## build

```zig
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

It will try to find `config.zig` as config file. If not found, will create it from `config.def.zig` as backup.

You can use `-Dconfig` to specify custom config file path, `-Dbar` to enable/disable status bar, default is true, `-Doptimize` to specify build mode.

## configuration

Make your custom modifications in `config.zig`.

## usage

Run `kwm` in your river init file or run with `river -c kwm`.

You could see all bindings in `config.zig`. It should be noted that the `quit` action only quit the kwm but not quit river session. It allow you restart kwm directly. If you want to quit river session, try to use `Ctrl+Alt+Delete`.
