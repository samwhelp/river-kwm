## Requirements

- Zig 0.15
- River Wayland compositor 0.4.x (with river-window-management-v1 protocol)

## Features

**Multiple layout:** tile, monocle, scroller, floating

**Tag:** base tags not workspaces (supports separate window layouts for each tag)

**Rule support:** regex rule match

**Bindings:** bindings in different mode such as default, passthrough orelse your custom mode

**Rich window state:** swallow, maximize, fullscreen, fakefullscreen

## build

```zig
zig build -Dconfig=/path/to/specify/config -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

It will try to find `config.zig` as config file. If not found, will use `config.def.zig` as backup.

You can use `-Dconfig` to specify custom config file path, `-Doptimize` to specify build mode.

## configuration

`cp config.def.zig config.zig` to create your own config file, and make custom modifications in `config.zig`.
